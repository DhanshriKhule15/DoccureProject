Git :

Git manages the project with repository.
	1.go to github.com and signup and sign in
	2.create an repository.
	3.donwload and install git bash in ur local.
	4.*First time when you will use gitbash you need to run bellow commands:
	git config --global user.email "myemail"
	git config --global user.name "myusername"
	git config --global user.password mypassword
    plz put your username, email and password exactly same which u have used when signing up to the github.com

	5.git clone "repourl" --- to pull or to download the repository code at local.
	6.Now I want to do initial setup of the project.
	7.git init === to initilize the git at local. 
	8.git status == this will show the changed or added or deleted status of every file in the branch.
	9.git add fileName == it will add perticular file to the stage env.
	10.git add . == it will add all the files that has been tracked in git status
	11.git commit -m "Message" == this will commit the code with perticular message.
	12.git push origin branch_name === this will upload or push the code at respective branch in repository.
	
	branch == When we create an new repository git will create main or master as an defualt branch.
			We can create our different branches to work on different functionality and at the end of the 
			day(devlopment) we need to merge the code at main branch.
			Final copy of main branch will be deployed and delivered to the client.
			
	git fetch == > it will fetch or download all the branches available at that repository.
	git checkout branch_name == > it will navigate to ur respective branch 
	
	And after u can do the development at ur branch and follor the same steps from git init step.
	
	Branches :
	total 7 developrs are working on one project so there will be one master or main branch. from that main branch 
	different branches will be created i.e. module or section wise.
	
	e.g. in our case we are creating two branches 1) booking_module 2) doctor_module.
	
	suppose three developer are working in booking module i.e Kajal, Sagar, Sidhant
	
	Now above three members will crete their seperate or topic branch from booking_module branch.
	 sagar_bm, kalaj_bm, sidhant_bm
	
	Once development is completed by above theee they will push their code in respective branch ie sagar_bm, kalaj_bm, sidhant_bm.
	
	Now these developers will merge the code into booking_module branch. 
	
	Likewise other developers are working on  their respective i.e doctor_module or common_module and they will peform the same operation.
	
	At the end code from booking_module, doctor_module, common_module and all other branches will be merged into main or master branch.
